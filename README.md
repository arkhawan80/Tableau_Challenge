Through City bike analytics of New York, first I tried to create a few visualizations that help the audience get an image of New York bike system through graphs, map, and charts that derived from two data sets of January 2019. I merged them first and manipulated it to create the visualizations. the two phenomena that I picked to look for were patterns and changes in number of rides, membership, start and stop times of riding bikes by age and gender. 

Through Start/End Stattions map graph, for example, you can see all bike stations in New York city, the name of starting and stopping station, their location, zip code, and number and id number bikes that are available can be seen. the size of each circle shows the size of the station in regards of number of bikes in that station. Also, the darker the circles get the bigger the size of number of bikes in the station to make it easy to visualize it.

One of the phenomena that I like to examine through this project is to see how utilizing bike in the city is influenced by gender. In regards of gender, I was expecting that due to high volume of population, diversity, and modern mindset of people in New York, to find out that both female and male similarly use bike to get to their jobs and places. What I found after comparing bike riding, timing, and membership of bike tickets, was that the line of bike usage by male is much higher than female and unknowns.

in regards of using bike for commute by birth year, there are a steady trend of increase in using bikes over the time in history but there are some exceptions in rising the number of riders, memberships by specific years or decades. For example, in 70s of the last century, there were a huge rise in commuting by bike. when I searched for reasons, oil prices crisis was one of the main factors behind that change. Also, as expected the number of bike riders rise when the riders are younger in age, since itâ€™s easier of young people to have necessary energy and strength to ride bike.
